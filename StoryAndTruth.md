### Story

It all began with me (TheDeibo) innocently playing a MCPE server, which I was a Head-Admin of, and unfortunately shut down. <br>
Luckily, I saved the world I so much loved. So, I made a server.

Not long after, my friend shown me a plugin he has made. The original ServerLove plugin that inspired this one. <br>
But it's not the beautiful start that you would know of, but it's a good start, never the less. My friend and I were talking about his plugin, and the subject of PocketMine came along. So, I betted him (No money, just a simple bet) that I could port the plugin over from Java (Bukkit) to PHP (PocketMine).

The bet was on! But it had a BAD start. I started to cheat and ask help on the request section on the forum to no luck. <br> **TICK** **TOCK**, **TICK** **TOCK**. Time was ticking. So, I decided to do some research. I started looking at GitHub. I started looking at other people's plugins, and the PocketMine API. It then started off as two plugins. ServerLove-EXT (Because I didn't understand php `CASE` at the time.). So, then I learnt from several plugins how to make commands and use events.
Sure, the code looks messy, even now... but the functionality is still there. The first Public release was my [1.3.0 release](https://github.com/TheDeibo/ServerLoveMCPE/commit/41299e97d282e9d0c51155ebb704b3cc21be5c9d). I have won my bet.<br><br><BR>

```
Q. So, why didn't I release a Public release earlier? 
A. This was because It was really intended to be private, but then I had the nice idea of releasing it. So, I added it to GitHub as a starter.

Q. So, why didn't I release it to PocketMine Forums until version 1.5.0
A. Simple answer: I made a few mistakes that were against the Submission Rules + Guidelines, and it's taken me a few releases to realise I needed to delete a few useless files. So, after a few trial and errors, I've submitted it.
```
<br><br><BR>

So, not soon after I uploaded it, I started to have another bet with my friend betting I can get more downloads than his plugin. Bet was on, and with a few updates later, guess who's won?<br>
No... its not Donald Duck... I won.

To this date (16th of January, 2017) I have counted ***22,289*** downloads on ServerLoveMCPE.

Ever since ServerLoveMCPE V3.2, I have stopped much development on the plugin, and moved on to other plugin development (Well, tweaking them.) My work on the plugin was done. So, I left the plugin alone (until it came to updating API, on v.3.2.1.).

### The Truth

Yes, it looks like I have abandoned my plugin. But the fact is, I (quite ironically) have lost my love for making and editing this plugin. It was a challenge and a bet between me and my friend. That was the main drive for the plugin. 

I do hope (some day) to resume development on this plugin, but It would take some time. <br>

I hope people understand. :)
